        <h1>Prince Jitendrakumar Gupta</h1>
        <p>Front-end Developer | Designer</p>
        <p>Hello, I'm Prince, a passionate front-end developer and computer engineering student.
          My journey into the world of web development started with a curiosity for creating visually appealing and
          interactive user experiences on the internet.
          Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, I have a strong foundation in both computer science and
          engineering principles.
          This academic background has provided me with a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and
          software development.</p>
